# Setup & Configuration

## Supported Language Versions

This SDK is compatible with the following versions: `TypeScript >= 4.8.4`

## Installation

To get started with the SDK, we recommend installing using `npm`:

```bash
npm install nuku
```

## Authentication

### Access Token Authentication

The Nuku API uses an Access Token for authentication.

This token must be provided to authenticate your requests to the API.

#### Setting the Access Token

When you initialize the SDK, you can set the access token as follows:

```ts
const sdk = new Nuku({ token: 'YOUR_TOKEN' });
```

If you need to set or update the access token after initializing the SDK, you can use:

```ts
const sdk = new Nuku();
sdk.token = 'YOUR_TOKEN';
```

## Setting a Custom Timeout

You can set a custom timeout for the SDK's HTTP requests as follows:

```ts
const nuku = new Nuku({ timeout: 10000 });
```

# Sample Usage

Below is a comprehensive example demonstrating how to authenticate and call a simple endpoint:

```ts
import { Nuku } from 'nuku';

(async () => {
  const nuku = new Nuku({
    token: 'YOUR_TOKEN',
  });

  const { data } = await nuku.breeds.getBreeds();

  console.log(data);
})();
```
