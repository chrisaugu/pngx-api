If you are interested to an existing issue, feel free to comment the issue or subscribe to it.

## Submitting pull requests

If you want to fix a bug or implement a new feature, feel free to submit a new pull request.
To submit a pull request, you have to fork this repository and fill the PR template.
When you want to submit a pull request, remember to:

- follow this project's code style
- run `./gradlew clean check`

## Contributing

This project is under active development and the code will likely change pretty significantly.

**At the moment, we only plan to prioritize reviewing external contributions for bugs or security fixes.**

If you want to add a new feature or change the behavior of an existing one, please open an issue proposing the feature and get approval from an OpenAI team member before spending time building it.

**New contributions that don't go through this process may be closed** if they aren't aligned with our current roadmap or conflict with other priorities/upcoming features.

### Development workflow

- Create a _topic branch_ from `main` - e.g. `feat/interactive-prompt`.
- Keep your changes focused. Multiple unrelated fixes should be opened as separate PRs.
- Following the [development setup](#development-workflow) instructions above, ensure your change is free of lint warnings and test failures.

### Writing high-impact code changes

1. **Start with an issue.** Open a new one or comment on an existing discussion so we can agree on the solution before code is written.
2. **Add or update tests.** Every new feature or bug-fix should come with test coverage that fails before your change and passes afterwards. 100% coverage is not required, but aim for meaningful assertions.
3. **Document behaviour.** If your change affects user-facing behaviour, update the README, inline help (`codex --help`), or relevant example projects.
4. **Keep commits atomic.** Each commit should compile and the tests should pass. This makes reviews and potential rollbacks easier.

### Opening a pull request

- Fill in the PR template (or include similar information) - **What? Why? How?**
- Run **all** checks locally (`cargo test && cargo clippy --tests && cargo fmt -- --config imports_granularity=Item`). CI failures that could have been caught locally slow down the process.
- Make sure your branch is up-to-date with `main` and that you have resolved merge conflicts.
- Mark the PR as **Ready for review** only when you believe it is in a merge-able state.

### Review process

1. One maintainer will be assigned as a primary reviewer.
2. If your PR adds a new feature that was not previously discussed and approved, we may choose to close your PR (see [Contributing](#contributing)).
3. We may ask for changes - please do not take this personally. We value the work, but we also value consistency and long-term maintainability.
4. When there is consensus that the PR meets the bar, a maintainer will squash-and-merge.

### Community values

- **Be kind and inclusive.** Treat others with respect; we follow the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).
- **Assume good intent.** Written communication is hard - err on the side of generosity.
- **Teach & learn.** If you spot something confusing, open an issue or PR with improvements.

### Getting help

If you run into problems setting up the project, would like feedback on an idea, or just want to say _hi_ - please open a Discussion or jump into the relevant issue. We are happy to help.

Together we can make Codex CLI an incredible tool. **Happy hacking!** :rocket:

### Contributor license agreement (CLA)

All contributors **must** accept the CLA. The process is lightweight:

1. Open your pull request.
2. Paste the following comment (or reply `recheck` if you've signed before):

   ```text
   I have read the CLA Document and I hereby sign the CLA
   ```

3. The CLA-Assistant bot records your signature in the repo and marks the status check as passed.

No special Git commands, email attachments, or commit footers required.

#### Quick fixes

| Scenario          | Command                                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Amend last commit | `git commit --amend -s --no-edit && git push -f` |

The **DCO check** blocks merges until every commit in the PR carries the footer (with squash this is just the one).

### Releasing `codex`

_For admins only._

Make sure you are on `main` and have no local changes. Then run:

```shell
VERSION=0.2.0  # Can also be 0.2.0-alpha.1 or any valid Rust version.
./codex-rs/scripts/create_github_release.sh "$VERSION"
```

This will make a local commit on top of `main` with `version` set to `$VERSION` in `codex-rs/Cargo.toml` (note that on `main`, we leave the version as `version = "0.0.0"`).

This will push the commit using the tag `rust-v${VERSION}`, which in turn kicks off [the release workflow](../.github/workflows/rust-release.yml). This will create a new GitHub Release named `$VERSION`.

If everything looks good in the generated GitHub Release, uncheck the **pre-release** box so it is the latest release.

Create a PR to update [`Formula/c/codex.rb`](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/main/Formula/c/codex.rb) on Homebrew.
